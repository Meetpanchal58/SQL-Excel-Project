## Root Cause Analysis Process
To ascertain a root cause analysis, we attempted to answer the followimg questions with the newly created tables

1. Overview of Academic Scores from Students
 - a) highest Academic Score by any Student
 - b) lowest Academic Score by any Student
 - c) Average Academic Score by any Student

2. Total Students distributed by their Grade based on their Academic Scores
 - a) Number of students who passed and who failed
 - b) Percentage of students who passed and who passed

3. Ethnicity wise Average Academic Scores and Unemployment Rate
 - a) Total Students Ethnicity Wise and their Average Academic Score
 - b) Total Students Ethnicity Wise and Their Average Unemployment Rate

4. Birth Year wise Student's Average AcademicScore 

5. Region wise Average amount spend on CollegeFees and Respective Average Academic Scores

6. Region wise Average distance Travel through college and Respective Average Academic Scores

7. Income group wise total tuition Fees Spend and Respective Average Academic Scores

8. Total Students distributed by gender and Their Average Academic Scores

9. Academic Scores based on Parents Educations
 - a) Average Academic Scores of Total Students whose any one of the parents is qualified
 - b) Average Academic Scores of Total Students whose both the parents are not qualified
